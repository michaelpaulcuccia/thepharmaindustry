/*
Difficulty Level and Complexity:
On a scale of 1 to 10, this task would rate around a 6 or 7 in difficulty. It required gathering, verifying, and formatting specific information from various sources, along with adding extra details like website URLs. The challenge mainly involved ensuring the accuracy and relevance of data and structuring it in the requested JSON format.

Memory Usage:
The memory used for this task is moderate—around 30-40% of what’s available for complex tasks. The memory usage comes from keeping track of data relationships, formatting it correctly, and ensuring it remains aligned with your needs. It's not as intensive as real-time calculations or complex code debugging but does use more memory than simple coding or design advice.

Comparison to Other Tasks:
Compared to other requests you've made, this was a bit more complex because it combined research, data structuring, and content creation. For example:

Design tweaks or layout advice would be around 2-3 in difficulty, with low memory usage.
Debugging code can range from 5-8, depending on complexity.
Providing coding snippets or guidance is usually around 4-5.
