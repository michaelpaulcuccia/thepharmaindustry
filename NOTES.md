ClinicalTrials.gov provides a robust API that allows you to search for clinical trials involving specific drugs. Here’s a step-by-step guide on making a request to find a drug and check for associated trials:

Step 1: Search for Trials Involving a Specific Drug
To find trials involving a specific drug, you can use the fullstudies endpoint of the ClinicalTrials.gov API. You will need to specify search parameters like the drug name.

Example Request to Find Trials for a Drug:
Here’s an example using fetch in JavaScript to search for a drug (e.g., "Keytruda"):

// Define an async function to fetch and handle the data
async function fetchDrugTrials(drugName) {
try {
// URL format for searching trials by a specific drug name
const url = `https://clinicaltrials.gov/api/query/full_studies?expr=${drugName}&min_rnk=1&max_rnk=10&fmt=json`;

    // Fetch data from the API
    const response = await fetch(url);
    // Check if the response is OK
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(`HTTP error! Status: ${response.status}`);
    }
    // Parse the JSON data
    const data = await response.json();

    // Log or process the data as needed
    console.log(data.FullStudiesResponse.FullStudies);

} catch (error) {
// Handle any errors that occurred during the fetch
console.error('Error fetching data:', error);
}
}

// Call the function with a specific drug name
fetchDrugTrials('Keytruda'); // Replace 'Keytruda' with the drug name you are interested in

Step 2: Check Trial Phases and Types
Once you have the trial data, you can check the Phase and StudyType fields in the JSON response to identify the types of trials:

Combination Therapy Trials: Look for keywords in BriefTitle, Description, or Interventions that suggest combination therapies.
Post-Marketing Surveillance and Phase IV Trials: Check the Phase field for "Phase IV." This is considered one item and is specifically about post-marketing surveillance.
Pediatric Trials: Check the Eligibility section for age criteria specifying children.
Formulation Changes: Look for keywords like "formulation," "extended-release," or similar in the BriefTitle or Description.
Example JSON Structure to Identify Trial Types:
A snippet of the relevant JSON response fields might look like this:

"FullStudiesResponse": {
"FullStudies": [
{
"Study": {
"ProtocolSection": {
"IdentificationModule": {
"BriefTitle": "A Study of Keytruda in Combination with Chemotherapy"
},
"DesignModule": {
"PhaseList": {
"Phase": ["Phase III"]
},
"StudyType": "Interventional"
},
"EligibilityModule": {
"MinimumAge": "2 Years",
"MaximumAge": "18 Years"
},
"DescriptionModule": {
"BriefSummary": "This trial is studying Keytruda in pediatric patients..."
}
}
}
}
]
}
}
Addressing Your QUESTION on Trial Types:
Combination Therapy Trials: Separate trials often exploring drug combinations.
Post-Marketing Surveillance and Phase IV Trials: Typically considered a single category but can be seen as two related items.
Pediatric Trials: Trials focused on children.
Formulation Changes: Trials exploring new forms or methods of drug delivery.
I hope this helps! If you’d like more specific examples or need help parsing the API response, let me know!
